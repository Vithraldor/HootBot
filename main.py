Developed for personal use by Vithraldor.
This is a basic bot that mimics an owl.

Past Versions:
v1.0 (6/9/2020): initial release of bot.
v1.1 (6/9/2020): minor bug fixes to F event, altered probability value for default case.
v1.2 (6/9/2020): Reworked F event: now increments instead of randomly generating numbers
